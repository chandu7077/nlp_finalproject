**Acknowledgement**
This work builds on the work presented in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.12848.pdf and extends it to optionally make use of the [XLNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.08237.pdf) architecture as well. As such, much of the open source code from the respective GitHub repositories for [UDA](https://github.com/google-research/uda) and [XLNet](https://github.com/zihangdai/xlnet) was leveraged for this project. Thank you!
